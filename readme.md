# Final Project: Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone

## Project overview
This project asks to design a small healthcare cloud solution that integrates multiple services such as Azure and GCP. The design implemented is for a automated claims processing and analytics dashboard. The solution allows healthcare billers to upload claim files and generate report and visualizations on processed data.

## Use Case Description
1. Description written to understand the target problem and the users of the solution.
    - Write the problem statement.
    - Describe the solution.
    - Describe the target users of the solution.

2. Describe the type of data and the source of the data in the solution.
    - Explain the data types that will be used.
    - Explain the source of the data.

3. Describe the basic workflow for the solution.
    - Create a list for the workflow of the application.
    - Should start from the user interacting with the solution to the solution solving a problem or generating something for the user.

## Architecture Diagram
Create a diagram for all the components of the solution and the data flow.
- Show the different layes of the architecture.
- Show all the cloud based services implemented.

## Architecture & Implementation Plan
1. Create a service map.
    - Show the layers that each cloud service resies in.
    - Describe the role of the cloud service in the solution.
    - Explain in which assignment/module was the cloud service talked about.

2. Create a data flow narrative.
    - A walkthrough of how the data moves through the solution.

3. Security, identity, and governance.
    - Expain security measures applied in the solution for data security.

4. Cost and operational management.
    - Explain what measures were taken to reduce cost of the application

## Reflection
Write a reflection on the design process.
- Describe creator confidence in different parts of the design.
- Describe alternative architectures that have been considered.
- Describe future implementations if creator had more time and resources.
